  <div>Looks like you are new. Lets get you started!</div>
  <div>You can either generate a new identity or upload one.</div>
  <div>An identity is somewhat like a user account, but serves as means to encrypt everything that happens here</div>

<button mat-flat-button (click)="generateIdentity()">Generate Identity</button>
<button mat-button color="primary" (click)="fileInput.click()">Upload Identity</button>
<input #fileInput type="file" hidden (change)="uploadIdentity($event)"/>
